Documentation for debugging scaling policy in code.
When creating a stack in cloudformation with existing template,
error: Encountered unsupported property "Scaling adjustment".

>> looked at aws documentation and noticed in our code block a policy type 
was not specified so I added one as "Target Tracking Scaling" and added some configurations.

>> I found target tracking through just recreating the manual steps to making an asg + asg policy 
so I thought perhaps I will just retrace the manual steps into code

>> I looked up some syntax through the aws documentation and was able to add it into the code

>> upon creating stack I decided to delete "Scaling Adjustment" and "Cool Down" because I kept getting 
errors when creating stack so I left it as this instead: 
  
  "PolicyType":"TargetTrackingScaling",
                "TargetTrackingConfiguration": {
                    "PredefinedMetricSpecification": {
                        "PredefinedMetricType": "ASGAverageCPUUtilization"
                    },
                    "TargetValue": 40 
                }

>> when I left it as this the cloudformation template was able to create the asg policy sucessfully

>> to verify this policy was created I went into AWS after the template was sucessfully deployed and went to 
autoscaling groups and checked the created policy. This was the policy:

Policy type:
Target tracking scaling
Enabled or disabled?
Enabled
Execute policy when:
As required to maintain Average CPU utilization at 40
Take the action:
Add or remove capacity units as required
Instances need:
300 seconds to warm up before including in metric
Scale in:
Enabled

>> this is the aws documentation I was referring to when finding the solution: 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-as-policy.html#aws-properties-as-policy--examples
